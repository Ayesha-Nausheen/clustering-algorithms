# clustering-algorithms
Hands-on implementations of clustering techniques including K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN, with visualizations using the Mall Customers dataset.

ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside
ðŸ”¹ Clustering Methods

K-Means Clustering â€“ partition-based clustering with centroids

Hierarchical Clustering â€“ agglomerative approach with dendrograms

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering) â€“ clustering based on density, capable of handling noise and outliers

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Mall_Customers.csv â†’ Contains customer data such as annual income and spending score, commonly used for segmentation analysis.
